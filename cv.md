## About Me:

> a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step

I spend all my free time learning frontend development. I really want to learn and develop new skills. This interests me because it gives me a sense of inexplicable ecstasy when I write "git push" in the console. It's incredible.

My ultimate goal is to level up in development, to find friends and inner Zen in this area.

I'll keep trying until I make it a reality.
